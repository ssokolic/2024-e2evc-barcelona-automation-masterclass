With more than 650.000 lines of code, 350 repositories and more than 8,000 work items in the books,
we will teach you everything you need to know in the following topics and present examples to explain
the most important requirements and concepts.

### We are developing a SaaS app and adjusted our infrastructure over time

#### Version 1

We used available cloud services as much as we can.

#### Version 2

We ran into limits with available cloud services and started migrating some services to Kubernetes.

#### Version 3

We got rid of most cloud-specific services as far as we can to be able to move to any platform we want and be as
independent as we can from the tools and solutions we use.
