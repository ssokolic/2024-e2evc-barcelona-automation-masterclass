# Start With the Perfect Team and Skills

Building a well-rounded infrastructure team requires a mix of roles that bring together expertise in areas such as cloud
computing, automation, security, and DevOps. Each role plays a specific part in ensuring that your infrastructure is
efficient, scalable, secure, and aligned with business goals.

## The Impact

> Implementing IaC inside a traditional IT environment can be compared to an asteroid hitting the earth - eliminating
> 75% of everything that lived there before.

### Relevant Skills and Experience

When looking for team members for an IaC implementation, you need to consider their skills and experience. Ideally, you
want team members who are proficient in coding, scripting, automation, and deployment processes. It’s essential to assess
their knowledge of infrastructure technologies, such as cloud computing platforms, network protocols, and databases.
You should also consider each candidate’s experience in working with infrastructure configurations, deployment tools,
and repositories.
If the available team members inside your organization lack experience you should make a plan and define a time frame in
which you want to get your team members into the right direction before they are thrown into the migration project.
Laying a solid foundation is the key to success.

> Do not underestimate the cost and time needed to gather some basic knowledge in all the above fields. Not investing
> in knowledge will lead to frustration and lack of experience and motivation in getting the job done.

### Evaluate Teamwork and Communication Skills

In an IaC integration, teamwork and communication skills are critical, given that the project involves multiple roles
working in close collaboration. You need team members who can effectively collaborate, communicate, and coordinate with
their peers to achieve common goals. Have a close look at your desired team members and their teamwork experiences,
their communication skills, and how they approach collaboration. It’s also essential to evaluate their flexibility and
ability to work in an agile environment.

> Communications skills are crucial for the success of such an implementation. It should be on-point, without to much
> side-information. Meetings and discussions should be well-prepared and as short as possible.

### Assess Commitment and Motivation

IaC implementations can be challenging and technically demanding, requiring persistence, dedication, and motivation. You need team members who are committed to the project's vision, goals, and challenges. Ensure that each one is clear on the project's scope, timelines, and objectives before onboarding them onto the team. It’s also crucial to evaluate their work ethic and passion for building innovative infrastructure solutions.

> Search for open-minded people with a variety of experiences in different fields.

> Invest time to define a clear vision and goal for your IaC implementation.

**Some places to get started**

A good starting point to get an idea how to assess these demands is the Manifesto for Agile Software Development. It
will help you ask the right questions.

The Scrum values should also give you a good starting point on how to identify your team members.

### Consider Cultural fit

Because an IaC implementation has a deep impact on the structure of the IT organization you should heavily focus on the
cultural fit of each potential team member.

If your worked in an ITIL process structure before, you will have to add at least one member of every delivery part of
the organization (storage, security, network, etc.) to the team to shorten communication and coordination. Prepare to
change the organization in long-term and transition it to a smaller, faster and more diverse structure.

> Organizational change is the hardest path in an IaC implementation. If you don't get it right, you won't have any
> benefit of it, because every change will take ages to be coordinated and approved.
> Evaluate also their values, beliefs, working habits, and personalities to ensure that they align with the project
> culture. It's essential to build a team that values diversity, inclusion, open communication, and continuous
> improvement.

> Team members who blame others for errors or that hide failures should never be integrated into such a team.

---

### Look for Continuous Improvers

IaC is a rapidly evolving field, and the technology and tools used in the field are constantly evolving.
Therefore, it is important to have a team that is willing to learn and adapt. Look for individuals who are committed to
being continuous learners, willing to keep up to date with the latest developments and adapt to new technologies.

> Prepare for the fact that you will never know anything because it changes constantly. This should be fun and not a
> duty for any team member.

### Define the Necessary Roles Inside Your Team

The structure of a DevOps team can vary depending on the size and complexity of the organization, but typically includes
the following roles:

---

#### Infrastructure Architect

Infrastructure Architects are responsible for designing and planning the overall infrastructure. They define the
structure, systems, and processes that the infrastructure team will implement, ensuring that they align with business
goals.

#### Skills Required

- Extensive knowledge of cloud architecture (AWS, Azure, GCP).
- Experience with networking, storage, security, and application deployment.
- Strong understanding of Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and automation.

> Why It's Important: The architect sets the blueprint for how your infrastructure will operate, ensuring scalability,
> reliability, and security.

---

#### DevOps Engineer

DevOps Engineers are responsible for designing and implementing automation and tooling to support the continuous integration and deployment of software. They work closely with developers and operations teams to ensure that software is delivered quickly and reliably.

##### Skills Required

- Expertise in automation tools (Terraform, Ansible, Jenkins).
- Knowledge of CI/CD pipelines and version control (Git, GitLab, CircleCI).
- Familiarity with cloud platforms and containerization (Docker, Kubernetes).

> Why It's Important: DevOps engineers ensure the continuous delivery of applications and services, speeding up
> deployments while maintaining high levels of reliability.

---

#### Software Developer / Cloud Engineer

Developers are responsible for writing and testing code. They work closely with DevOps Engineers to ensure that code can
be easily integrated and deployed using automated pipelines.

##### Skills Required

- Deep knowledge of cloud services (AWS, Azure, GCP).
- Familiarity with infrastructure automation (CloudFormation, Terraform).
- Monitoring and logging (AWS CloudWatch, Azure Monitor, Prometheus).

> Why It's Important: As businesses increasingly rely on cloud services, cloud engineers ensure the infrastructure is
> resilient, secure, and cost-effective.
