As a CTO, there are a wide range of tools that can help you manage and optimize your organization's technology stack. Here are some of the most essential tools of the trade: 1. Cloud Platforms: Cloud platforms such as AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud provide a range of tools and services for managing infrastructure, deploying applications, and storing data. 2. DevOps Tools: DevOps tools such as Git, Jenkins, and Ansible can help streamline the software development process, automate deployments, and improve collaboration between development and operations teams. 3. Containers: Containers such as Docker and Kubernetes can help simplify application deployment and management by encapsulating applications and their dependencies in a portable package. 4. Monitoring and Analytics: Monitoring and analytics tools such as New Relic, Datadog, and Splunk can help you identify and resolve issues in real-time, as well as gain insights into application performance and user behavior. 5. Productivity Tools: Productivity tools such as Slack, Trello, and Asana can help improve communication and collaboration within your team, as well as help you manage tasks and projects more efficiently. 6. Security Tools: Security tools such as Auth0, Okta, and Palo Alto Networks can help protect your organization's infrastructure and data from unauthorized access and cyber threats. 7. Data Storage and Management: Data storage and management tools such as MongoDB, Elasticsearch, and Redis can help you store and manage large amounts of data, as well as gain insights from that data through analytics and visualization tools. 8. AI and Machine Learning: AI and machine learning tools such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Amazon SageMaker can help you develop and deploy intelligent applications and services that can learn and improve over time.
By leveraging these tools and others, CTOs can help their organizations stay competitive, innovate faster, and deliver better experiences to their customers.

I was born long ago as an IT infrastructure guy and slowly transitioned over the years from being an in-house administrator, to external consultant, to freelancer and at last to one of the founding members behind RIS AG.
Nearly 23 years I am now in it and finally feel like home where I currently am.

In my role I am responsible for the strategy behind our services and the technologies we provide in our consulting business and our software development unit XOAP.

Because we are a small company I still have contact in terms of hands-on implementations inside customer projects, as well as in our product development. And I do not want to miss this .

So my days transitions between:

    • filling product backlogs
    • doing customer presentations
    • testing new features
    • writing documentation
    • proof-reading of concepts and documents our consultants write for our customers
    • write Packer, Terraform, PowerShell DSC configs and modules
    • package applications
    • research new technologies
    • guide new colleagues into the "right" direction
    • have strategic management meetings
    • talk to customers
    • create presentations
    • write blogs, tweets and create Youtube content out of this material
    • talk to candidates and search for the right ones

Over the years I created a sort of "my" toolset I can handle all of this stuff in an organized and optimized way.
But I have to mention that there is always room for improvement. I am still far away from the point where I would personally like to be from this aspect.

Hardware
Apple Mac
It is not that I tried it a few times to use Windows as my main working environment. But since I started using Macs since 2001 with the first G5 I always preferred MacOS because it is much more convenient to use with minor trouble and since all this Infrastructure as Code toolset came up it is the better suited platform for those types of work.
Currently I am using an Apple MacBook Pro 16" M2 with 64 GB of RAM and 2 TB hard disc. Besides the current issues with ARM based VMs it is my perfect fit (luckily Parallels resolved those issues)

Tools
Lets have a look at the different tools I am using everyday.
Demos
RoyalTSX
For demos I personally like Royal TSX, because it is so powerful in managing credentials and VMs, as well as different resources you can add to the demo (like websites, scripts, SSH connections and much more).
Parallels Desktop
Lately after I got my M2 Mac I was really disappointed about how VMware Fusion provided support for ARM based Windows 11 and other operating systems (yes, for DSC authoring and packaging for Windows local VMs IMHO still make much more sense then spinning up costly VMs in the cloud).
I wasn`t considering Parallels at all before but as I tested it out of curiosity because of an add on Twitter I directly made the switch. It is currently so much more convenient then VMware Fusion that it just makes sense to use it because it provisions faster and much more easily ARM based VMs on the Mac. In addition to that I like the suspension feature that saves so much battery life even if I currently don`t care to much about it because the 16" MacBook runs like forever on battery.

Coding
For coding it depends totally on the task I am trying to achieve. This is the reason why I am using more then one IDE to get the job done.
IntelliJ IDEA
This is my preferred development environment for all Terraform related tasks. The Terraform implementation is so much better then anything in VS Code. Especially if you write a lot of Stacks and modules the changing of resource names or variables (telling you which one you haven specified in vars or outputs is a breeze).
VS Code
This is the everyday development tool for all PowerShell related stuff like scripting and PowerShell DSC.
GitHub Desktop
We currently have more then 400 git repositories in place for all kind of stuff. GitHub Desktop makes it easy to clone from different locations and keep track of the changes without having to search through the file system.
GitHub Copilot
Who needs developers? GitHub Copilot makes it so much easier to write any kind of code with its auto completion. It is really scary how good this thing assumes what you are trying to achieve.
