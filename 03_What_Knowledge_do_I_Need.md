## Basic Understanding of IT Infrastructure

### Networks and Servers

Understand how servers, networks, and storage work, including virtual machines, containers, and cloud services.
This will help you automate tasks related to resource provisioning, networking, and system management.

### Operating Systems

Be familiar with the operating systems you will be managing (e.g., Linux, Windows). Know how to navigate the file
system, manage processes, configure settings, and troubleshoot issues.

## Scripting and Programming

### Basic Scripting Skills

Automation often involves writing scripts to manage infrastructure. Familiarity with scripting languages such as:

- Bash (for Linux environments),
- PowerShell (for Windows environments),
- Python (commonly used for various automation tasks across platforms), is essential.
- YAML: Many automation tools use YAML for configuration files.
- JSON: JSON is another common format for configuration files and API responses.
- HCL: HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL) is used in tools like Terraform for defining infrastructure as code.
- SQL: If you are working with databases, knowledge of SQL for querying and managing databases is important.
- Regular Expressions: Regular expressions are used for pattern matching and text processing.
- Markdown: Markdown is commonly used for documentation.
- Programming Concepts: Understanding programming concepts like variables, loops, conditionals, functions, and error
  handling will help you write efficient and maintainable automation scripts.
- API Knowledge: Understanding how to interact with APIs is important because many cloud services and automation
  tools expose APIs for managing resources programmatically.
