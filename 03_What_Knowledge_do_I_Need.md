# What Knowledge do I Need?

To get started with automation, you’ll need a mix of foundational knowledge and hands-on skills that cover areas like
infrastructure, scripting, and specific tools. Here’s a breakdown of the essential knowledge you should have:

## Basic Understanding of IT Infrastructure

    > Networks and Servers: Understand how servers, networks, and storage work, including virtual machines, containers,
        and cloud services. This will help you automate tasks related to resource provisioning, networking, and system
        management.

    > Operating Systems: Be familiar with the operating systems you will be managing (e.g., Linux, Windows). Know how to
        navigate the file system, manage processes, configure settings, and troubleshoot issues.

Scripting and Programming

    > Basic Scripting Skills: Automation often involves writing scripts to manage infrastructure. Familiarity with
        scripting languages such as:

    	> Bash (for Linux environments),

    	> PowerShell (for Windows environments),

    	> Python (commonly used for various automation tasks across platforms), is essential.

        > YAML: Many automation tools use YAML for configuration files. Understanding YAML syntax is important for
            defining infrastructure and automation workflows.

        > JSON: JSON is another common format for configuration files and API responses. Knowing how to read and write
            JSON data is useful for interacting with APIs and automation tools.

        > HCL: HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL) is used in tools like Terraform for defining infrastructure as
            code. Understanding HCL syntax is crucial for writing Terraform configurations.

        > SQL: If you are working with databases, knowledge of SQL for querying and managing databases is important.

        > Regular Expressions: Regular expressions are used for pattern matching and text processing. Knowing how to use
            regex can help automate tasks that involve text manipulation.

        > Markdown: Markdown is commonly used for documentation. Understanding Markdown syntax will help you create and
            format documentation for your automation projects.

    > Programming Concepts: Understanding programming concepts like variables, loops, conditionals, functions, and error
            handling will help you write efficient and maintainable automation scripts.

    > API Knowledge: Understanding how to interact with APIs is important because many cloud services and automation
            tools expose APIs for managing resources programmatically.

Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

    > IaC Concepts: Learn the principles of Infrastructure as Code, which allows you to define and manage your
        infrastructure using code. This helps in making infrastructure deployment more consistent,
        version-controlled, and repeatable.

    	> Terraform: A widely used tool for managing infrastructure across different cloud providers. You should
            understand the basic syntax (HCL - HashiCorp Configuration Language), how to write modules, and how to use
            providers to interact with cloud resources.

    	> Ansible: While Ansible is primarily a configuration management tool, it can also be used for infrastructure
            automation. Learn how to define infrastructure tasks using Ansible playbooks.

            or Jinja2 templates. Understanding Deployment Manager is crucial for automating Google Cloud deployments.

        > CLI Tools: Many cloud providers offer command-line interfaces (CLIs) that allow you to interact with cloud
            resources. Understanding how to use these CLIs can help automate tasks and manage resources from the command
            line.

        > AWS CloudFormation / Azure Resource Manager (ARM) / Google Cloud Deployment Manager: These tools are specific
            to certain cloud providers and allow you to define cloud resources in templates.

    > Version Control: Since IaC is treated like software code, knowledge of version control tools like Git is essential
            for tracking changes, collaborating with teams, and ensuring the reliability of infrastructure deployments.
