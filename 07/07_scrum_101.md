Scrum is a framework for developing, delivering, and sustaining complex products and is the leading agile development method in software manufacturing and enjoys increasing popularity in all infrastructural areas. This page will show you the most important knowledge if you are new into Scrum for enhancing your comprehension. Further information can be found in this OneNote, the official Scrum Guide or by consulting the Scrum Master.

The Scrum Framework consists of the following components:

Scrum Roles and their main tasks
The Product Owner is responsible for maximizing the value of the product resulting from work of the Development Team. The Product Owner is the sole person responsible for managing the Product Backlog. The Product Owner is one person, not a committee.

The Scrum Master is responsible for promoting and supporting Scrum as defined in the Scrum Guide. Scrum Masters do this by helping everyone understand Scrum theory, practices, rules, and values. The Scrum Master is a servant-leader for the Scrum Team.

The Development Team consists of professionals who do the work of delivering a potentially releasable Increment of “Done” product at the end of each Sprint. Optimal Development Team size is small enough to remain nimble and large enough to complete significant work within a Sprint. Fewer than three Development Team members decrease interaction and results in smaller productivity gains. Having more than nine members requires too much coordination.

Scrum Artifacts

Product Backlog

The Product Backlog lists all features, functions, requirements, enhancements, and fixes that constitute the changes to be made to the product in future releases. The Product Backlog is dynamic; it constantly changes to identify what the product needs to be appropriate, competitive, and useful.

Product Backlog refinement(also known as Backlog Grooming) is the act of adding detail, estimates, and order to items in the Product Backlog. During Product Backlog refinement, items are reviewed and revised. The Scrum Team decides how and when refinement is done. Refinement usually consumes no more than 10% of the capacity of the Development Team.Higher ordered Product Backlog items are usually clearer and more detailed than lower ordered ones.

Sprint Backlog

The Sprint Backlog is the set of Product Backlog items selected for the Sprint, plus a plan for delivering the product Increment and realizing the Sprint Goal.

Increment

The Increment(also known as shippable Product or Product Increment) is the sum of all the Product Backlog items completed during a Sprint and the value of the increments of all previous Sprints.

Definition of “Done”

When a Product Backlog item or an Increment is described as “Done”, everyone must understand what “Done” means.

Scrum Events

The Sprint

The heart of Scrum is a Sprint, a time-box of one month or less during which a “Done”, useable, and potentially releasable product Increment is created. Sprints have consistent durations throughout a development effort. A new Sprint starts immediately after the conclusion of the previous Sprint.

Sprints contain and consist of the Sprint Planning, Daily Scrums, the development work, the Sprint Review, and the Sprint Retrospective.

Sprint Planning

The work to be performed in the Sprint is planned at the Sprint Planning. This plan is created by the collaborative work of the entire Scrum Team. Sprint Planning is time-boxed to a maximum of eight hours for a one-month Sprint. For shorter Sprints, the event is usually shorter.

Sprint Planning answers the following: - What can be delivered in the Increment resulting from the upcoming Sprint? - How will the work needed to deliver the Increment be achieved?

Daily Scrum

The Daily Scrum is a 15-minute time-boxed event for the Development Team. The Daily Scrum is held every day of the Sprint. At it, the Development Team plans work for the next 24 hours.

Some Development Teams will use questions, some will be more discussion based. Here is an example of what might be used: - What did I do yesterday that helped the Development Team meet the Sprint Goal? - What will I do today to help the Development Team meet the Sprint Goal? - Do I see any impediment that prevents me or the Development Team from meeting the Sprint Goal?

Sprint Retrospective

The Sprint Retrospective is an opportunity for the Scrum Team to inspect itself and create a plan for improvements to be enacted during the next Sprint.

"Your company has to develop and support a learning/teaching and continuous improvement mind set. People need to be encouraged to experiment and fail, in order to quickly learn."
