    1. Terraform can be used for more than just cloud infrastructure: While Terraform is often associated with cloud infrastructure and provisioning servers and services in cloud providers like AWS, Azure and Google Cloud Platform, it can also be used to manage on-premise infrastructure, containers, and even networking.
    2. Terraform does not define your entire infrastructure: Although Terraform can be used to define your infrastructure, it does not replace your existing processes and technologies. It’s just a tool that offers a unified language and interface to manage your infrastructure.
    3. Terraform is opinionated: Terraform has a preferred structure for organizing code and modules, and its default behaviors can sometimes surprise users. It’s important to understand Terraform's design paradigms and principles to avoid confusion while writing code.
    4. Terraform doesn’t guarantee idempotency: While Terraform’s goal is to keep your infrastructure in sync with your code without causing unwanted side effects, it’s still possible to create non-idempotent configurations. Terraform users must be careful when changing or deleting resources.

Terraform is constantly evolving: Terraform is an open-source tool that is updated frequently with new features and changes. Keeping up with these changes can be challenging, but it’s important to stay up-to-date to leverage the latest capabilities and ensure a more secure and efficient infrastructure.
